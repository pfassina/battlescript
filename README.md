# battlescript

Creates a dominions map file to be used with [DasTactic's Arena Map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1404827698&searchtext=arena).

Takes as input a list of python dictionaries contaitining commanders, magic paths, and units for each nation. Battlescript will then update the map file with pre-defined units for each nation. 

Runs on Python 3.7

## How to Run battlescript

### Function main()
To run battlescript all you need to do is call the main function with your python dictionary

```main(dictionary)``` 


### From Terminal
Alternatively, you can also pass the dictionary as a JSON string and call batlescript from terminal.

```python3 main.py 'dictionary'```


### Update Arena.Map file
The script will create a ```Arena.map``` file on the current work directory.
You can replace Das's original map file with the one generated by this script.
Games created with this new map file will have nations with armies predefined by this script.


## Dictionary Format

```
dict = [
    {
        'id': '# Nation Id',
        'province': '# Province Number',
        'commanders': [
            ('# Commander Id', ['#PathLevel', ...], [('#Unit Id', 'Quantity'), ...]),
            ...
        ]
    },
    {
        'id': '# Nation Id',
        'province': '# Province Number',
        'commanders': [
            ('# Commander Id', ['#PathLevel', ...], [('#Unit Id', 'Quantity'), ...]),
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]
```

## Real Example

    {
        'id': 74,
        'province': 12,
        'commanders': [
            (333, ['E1', 'S1', 'H2'], []),
            (333, ['S2', 'H2'], [(337, 60)]),
            (333, ['S2', 'H2'], [(337, 59)]),
            (333, ['E1', 'S1', 'H2'], [(337, 20)]),
            (1518, ['W3', 'S1'], []),
            (1518, ['W2', 'S2'], []),
            (1518, ['W2', 'E1', 'S1'], []),
            (1518, ['W2', 'S1', 'N1'], []),
            (1518, ['W2', 'S1', 'N1'], []),
            (443, ['S1'], [])
        ]
    },
    {
        'id': 44,
        'province': 5,
        'commanders': [
            (258, [], [(197, 122), (1657, 37)]),

            (188, [], [(187, 45), (186, 35)]),
            (188, [], [(1658, 46), (186, 34)]),
            (240, [], []),
